Reference 1: pyc files are created by the Python interpreter when a . py file is imported. They contain the "compiled bytecode" of the imported module/program so that the "translation" from source code to bytecode (which only needs to be done once) can be skipped on subsequent imports if the . pyc is newer than the corresponding .

This repository is an absolute god-dam mess. So if you are interested, you can open an(or multiple) issue for contributing is this repo.
